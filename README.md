# Long_Quiz_PartB-
This github repo has been created for Machine learning model deployment as a part of longquiz part B. This dataset focuses on students' performance in mathematics, reading, and writing, influenced by factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch accessibility, and participation in a test preparation course. In this project, we aim to predict math scores, which will serve as our target variable, while considering the other attributes as independent variables.

Given the nature of the task as a regression problem, we plan to employ various traditional machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBRegressor, CatBoost Regressor, and AdaBoost Regressor. We will conduct a comparative analysis of the prediction performance of these algorithms, selecting the one that achieves the highest accuracy score following the hyper-parameter optimization during the training phase.
